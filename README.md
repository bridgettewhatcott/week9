## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
A multiplexer takes multiple inputs and selects one of them using switches/buttons.
### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
A demultiplexer takes one input (can be the output of the multiplexer) and generates multiple outputs.
### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
We can use Shannon's method to find the minterm of a function. In this form, we can apply a multiplexer or multiple.
